AIM : Study of necessary header files with respect of socket programming

Socket header files contain data definitions, structures, constants, macros, and options used
by socket subroutines.
An application program must include the appropriate header file to make use of structures or
other information a particular socket subroutine requires. Commonly used socket header files
are:

Item Description
/usr/include/netinet/in.h Defines Internet constants and structures.
/usr/include/arpa/nameser.h Contains Internet name server information.
/usr/include/netdb.h Contains data definitions for socket subroutines.
/usr/include/resolv.h Contains resolver global definitions and variables.
/usr/include/sys/socket.h Contains data definitions and socket structures.
/usr/include/sys/socketvar.h Defines the kernel structure per socket and contains buffer

queues.

/usr/include/sys/types.h Contains data type definitions.
/usr/include/sys/un.h Defines structures for the UNIX interprocess communication

domain.

/usr/include/sys/ndd_var.h Defines structures for the operating system Network Device

Driver (NDD) domain.

/usr/include/sys/atmsock.h

Contains constants and structures for the Asynchronous
Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol in the operating system NDD
domain.

Aim: Study of necessary header files with respect to socket programming and of Basic
Functions of Socket Programming.

The primary socket API functions and methods in this module are:
socket()
.bind()
.listen()
.accept()
.connect()
.connect_ex()
.send()

Listening port: Listen ()
Data transmission: Send (), Recv ()
Input/Output multiplexing: Select ()
Disable socket only: closesocket ()

AIM : Study Of IPv6 Addressing And Subnetting

Aim- To study IPv6 addressing and subnetting IPv6 Addressing Modes Addressing mode refers
to the mechanism of hosting an address on the network. IPv6 offers several types of modes by
which a single host can be addressed. More than one host can be addressed at once or the host at
the closest distance can be addressed.
Technical Objective: IPv6 addresses use 128 bits to represent an address which includes bits to
be used for subnetting. The second half of the address (least significant 64 bits) is always used
for hosts only. Therefore, there is no compromise if we subnet the network. Simulate the same.
Given Requirements: IPv6 protocol has to be studied in detail and then simulated using routers
and PC in Cisco packet tracer simulation software with the packet ICMPv6 to demonstrate
subnet mask feature of IPv6 protocol.
Unicast:
In unicast mode of addressing, an IPv6 interface (host) is uniquely identified in a network
segment. The IPv6 packet contains both source and destination IP addresses. A host interface is
equipped with an IP address which is unique in that network segment. When a network switch or
a router receives a unicast IP packet, destined to a single host, it sends out one of its outgoing
interfaces which connects to that particular host.

** UNICAST IMAGE **


Multicast :
The IPv6 multicast mode is the same as that of IPv4. The packet destined to multiple hosts is
sent on a special multicast address. All the hosts interested in that multicast information, need to
join that multicast group first. All the interfaces that joined the group receive the multicast packet
and process it, while other hosts not interested in multicast packets ignore the multicast
information.

** MULTICAST IMAGE **


Anycast :
IPv6 has introduced a new type of addressing, which is called Anycast addressing. In this
addressing mode, multiple interfaces (hosts) are assigned the same Anycast IP address. When a
host wishes to communicate with a host equipped with an Anycast IP address, it sends a Unicast
message. With the help of a complex routing mechanism, that Unicast message is delivered to
the host closest to the Sender in terms of Routing cost.

** ANYCAST **

Address Structure:
An IPv6 address is made of 128 bits divided into eight 16-bits blocks. Each block is then
converted into 4- digit Hexadecimal numbers separated by colon symbols. For example, given
below is a 128-bit IPv6 address represented in binary format and divided into eight 16- bits
blocks:
0010000000000001 0000000000000000 0011001000111000 1101111111100001
0000000001100011 0000000000000000 0000000000000000 1111111011111011.
Each block is then converted into Hexadecimal and separated by ‘:’
symbol: 2001:0000:3238:DFE1:0063:0000:0000:FEFB
IPv6 Subnetting:
In IPv4, addresses were created in classes. Classful IPv4 addresses clearly define the bits used
for network prefixes and the bits used for hosts on that network. To subnet in IPv4, we play with
the default classful netmask which allows us to borrow host bits to be used as subnet bits. This
results in multiple subnets but less hosts per subnet. That is, when we borrow host bits to create a
subnet, it costs us in lesser bit to be used for host addresses. IPv6 addresses use 128 bits to
represent an address which includes bits to be used for subnetting. The second half of the address
(least significant 64 bits) is always used for hosts only. Therefore, there is no compromise if we
subnet the network.

** DIAGRAM
ROUTING PREFIX (48 bits) | SUBNET ID (16bits) | INTERFACE ID (64 bits)
**

16 bits of subnet is equivalent to IPv4’s Class B Network. Using these subnet bits, an
organization can have another 65 thousand of subnets which is by far, more than enough. Thus,
routing prefix is /64 and host portion is 64 bits. We can further subnet the network beyond 16
bits of Subnet ID, by borrowing host bits; but it is recommended that 64 bits should always be
used for hosts addresses because auto-configuration requires 64 bits. IPv6 subnetting works on
the same concept as Variable Length Subnet Masking in IPv4. /48 prefix can be allocated to an
organization providing it the benefit of having up to /64 subnet prefixes, which is 65535
sub networks, each having 264 hosts.

Result- Study IPv6 addressing and subnetting IPv6 Addressing Modes Addressing
mode refers to the mechanism of hosting an address on the network. IPv6 offers
several types of modes by which a single host can be addressed. More than one host
can be addressed at once or the host at the closest distance can be addressed.

AIM : Implementation of NAT

Aim: To study and perform Network Address Translation (NAT) using cisco packet tracer. 
Procedure:
Assign the following topology with respective IP addresses to pc, routers, servers and connection
between them.

** NAT diagram **

Configure static NAT configuration
Since static NAT use manual translation, we have to map each inside local IP address(which needs a
translation) with inside global IP address. Following command is used to map the inside local IP
address with inside global IP address.
Router(config)#ip nat inside source static [inside local ip address] [inside global IP address]
And use the following commands to define inside and outside network connection for your local and
global
IP addresses.
Router(config-if)#ip nat inside
Router(config-if)#ip nat outsideImplementation of VPN
Configure the IP routing
IP routing is the process which allows router to route the packet between different networks.

AIM : Implementation of VPN


Aim- To study about Virtual Private Network.
Technical Objective:
can be spoofed by using VPN service provided by different organizations.
Steps to Automate VPN using Python:
Step 1: Open your terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and create a file using gedit by typing the following command
on the terminal.
gedit gfg.py
Step 2: import the modules of python into the opened file.
Step 3: Create a list of Free VPN server codes provided by Windscribe (VPN).
Step 4: Start a try block connect with Windscribe using os module
Step 5: Start a catch block and then:
Disconnect the VPN, it will run if it gets any error.
Display a disconnection message here.

Code
# import required modules
import os
from time import sleep
import random
# list of VPN server codes
codeList = ["TR", "US-C", "US", "US-W", "CA", "CA-W",
"FR", "DE", "NL", "NO", "RO", "CH", "GB", "HK"]
try:
# connect to VPN
os.system("windscribe connect")
while True:
# assigning a random VPN server code
choiceCode = random.choice(codeList)
# changing IP after a particular time period
sleep(random.randrange(120, 300))
# connecting to a different VPN server
print("!!! Changing the IP Address........")
os.system("windscribe connect " + choiceCode)
except:
# disconnect VPN
os.system("windscribe disconnect")
print("sorry, some error has occurred..!!")

Result: Implementation of VPN is executed successfully.

AIM : Communication Using HDLC/PPP


Aim- To study about HDLC (High Level Data Link Control) and PPP (point to point): protocols
in cisco packet tracer.
Technical Objective: The encapsulation protocols of HDLC and PPP are two different ways in
which this is implemented within the connections, so after studying and understanding the
differences between them, demonstrate the differences between them using Cisco packet tracer.
Given Requirements: HDLC and PPP are two different types of communication methods, so
give a detailed description and analysis of both and show there difference in cisco packet tracer
simulation software.
HDLC (High Level Data Link Control):
HDLC is a data link protocol used on synchronous serial data links. Because the standardized
HDLC cannot support multiple protocols on a single link (lack of a mechanism to indicate which
protocol is carried), Cisco developed a proprietary version of HDLC, called cHDLC, with a
proprietary field acting as a protocol field. This field makes it possible for a single serial link to
accommodate multiple network-layer protocols.

HDLC IN CISCO:
By default, in the cisco packet tracer it is already HDLC.

not we can use the CLI commands to enable it the commands are

Router-B(config)#interface serial 0/0/0

58

Router-B(config-if)#encapsulation hdlc
Router-B(config-if)#ip address 192.168.10.5 255.255.255.252
Router-B(config-if)#no shutdown


PPP (point to point):
The username of one router should be the hostname of other and if there are two routers this
happens.
And the passwords should be same for both routers in case if we take any two routers.
And we are using chap in ppp to test this ppp The commands are:-
r1(config)# int se0/3/0
R1(config t)# encapsulation ppp
R1(config t)#ppp authentication chap.
